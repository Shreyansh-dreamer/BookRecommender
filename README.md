#Book Recommender
i have used 2 types of recommendation system in the model
1) Popularity-based:- Based on currently what is the most popular 
2) Collaborative based :- Based on what other users having the same book likings have read
For the website , I have used FastAPI for writing the backend, and React, JS for the frontend along with tailwind for styling
